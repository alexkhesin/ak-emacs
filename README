This assumes an empty ~/.emacs.d/ and emacs 24.

Clone the repository into your ~/.emacs.d/ and put the following into
your .emacs:

(load-file (expand-file-name "init.el"
            (concat user-emacs-directory "ak-emacs")))

you might have to restart emacs a few times to let el-get download all packages
((el-get 'wait) seems busted?)

Needs
   $ sudo port install aspell aspell-dict-en
to install on a Mac

If you work for Google, consider copying ~alexk/.emacs.d/local.el to your ~/.emacs.d/

=======

Scripts to use emacs in daemon mode are in ~/.emacs.d/ak-emacs/bin directory; the following shell configuration is recommended:

alias e="~/emacs.d/ak-emacs/bin/emacs-connect emacs.default"
alias e1="~/emacs.d/ak-emacs/bin/emacs-connect emacs.1"
... repeat for as many independent emacs sessions as your workflow requires

export P4EDITOR=~/.emacs.d/ak-emacs/bin/emacs-p4
export GIT_EDITOR="~/.emacs.d/ak-emacs/bin/emacs-connect emacs.git -t"
